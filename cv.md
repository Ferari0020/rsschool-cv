## Briefly About Myself:
I graduated from the Higher Technical College with a degree in software engineering. They taught a little bit of everything, but I was interested in the lessons on learning HTML and CSS, as well as to some extent the js language. My goal is to become a professional JavaScript/Front-end developer and learn English to the fullest.
I think my qualities of perseverance and hard work will help with this.

+ Git, Github\

## Code example:

```
 function multiply(a, b){
 return a * b
}

describe("Multiply", () => {
  it("fixed tests", () => {
    assert.strictEqual(multiply(1,1), 1);
    assert.strictEqual(multiply(2,1), 2);
  });
}); 
```
